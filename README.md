# cpplibs_starter_basic
Basic CPP cmake with static and dynamic libs. Use this as a boilerplate to get started.
Output executable and shared libs are in the bin folder.

## Build and Run Instructions
### Visual Studio Code
This is the easiest way to build and run. You don't even need to run CMake 'configure' and 'generate'. VS Code does it all.  
Just open root folder, set the right CMake active kit, build and run. It should build all libs and run the executable.
